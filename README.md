- 👋 Hi, I’m @dexprexxtion
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, JavaScript, React, JS Frameworks, Backend and a lot of the Hub, if you know what I mean... ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, how to cook, writing clean code, how to not be bad coder, more JS Frameworks and a lot of World History at school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React Projects, Sideprojects, Websites and literally anything to practice and get my skills sharpened.
- 📫 You can reach me out at ketanchowdhury@protonmail.com and on Twitter at @dexprexxtion
